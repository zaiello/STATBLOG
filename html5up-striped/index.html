								Each and every day of our lives we make hypotheses. 
								Which route to work will be shorter in morning traffic? How much will a doctor’s 
								appointment cost? We use the information we have at our disposal and then we take 
								actions informed by our hypotheses. This type of hypothesis testing might be adequate 
								for our day-to-day lives but what if we wanted a more accurate and precise method?
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Statistical Hypothesis Testing</strong> <br>
								To demonstrate the use of statistical hypothesis testing, we will use Oregon housing data 
								from the American Community Survey to investigate whether people living in apartments pay 
								less in electricity than those living in houses. 
							</p>
							<p>
								To answer the question of whether people living in apartments pay less in electricity than 
								those living in houses, we must specify a model that captures the relationship between 
								household type and monthly electricity cost while controlling for confounding variables. 
								Our response (dependent) variable is monthly electricity cost, and our explanatory 
								(independent) variable is housing type (apartment or house). We will also include explanatory 
								variables for the number of tenants, and the number of bedrooms in the housing unit. 
								By including these extra explanatory variables, we can control for their effects on 
								electricity cost thereby isolating the relationship between electricity and housing type. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The model form we will choose to represent this relationship is a Multiple Linear Regression 
								because MLRs model relationships between one quantitative dependent variable (Electricity)  
								and multiple independent variables using a straight line. How do we know that the relationship
								between electricity and our chosen independent variables are straight lines? We can plot 
								electricity against all our independent variables to see. 
							</p>
							<p>
								All our independent variables: housing type, household size, and number of bedrooms are 
								discrete meaning that they can only take on distinct values. You can’t have 1.7 people 
								living in a household, for example. Housing type is a nominal variable: it has two or 
								more categories that have no intrinsic ordering. Nominal variables cannot violate the 
								linearity assumption. Let’s take a look at the graph for electricity vs. the household size:
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture1.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								The relationship between electricity and the household size seems to be linear until the 
								household size is 10. This could be because there are not many observations for larger 
								household sizes. Let’s look at the number of observations by household size: 
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture2.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								After household size = 9 people, there are less than 10 observations for each household 
								size and household size = 13 people only has one observation. Let’s assume that we would
								see a linear relationship between household size and electricity cost if all the household 
								size categories had more than 15-30 observations. Let’s look at the other plots:
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture3.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								We’re having the same problem for apartment electricity costs that is also probably due to 
								the low sample sizes at higher household sizes. 
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture4.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								We’ll assume that this relationship is also linear. Next, let’s look at the electricity 
								vs. bedroom plots:
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture5.png" alt="" /></a>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture6.png" alt="" /></a>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture7.png" alt="" /></a>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture8.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								The electricity costs for apartments by bedrooms plot seems to also have the problem of 
								low sample sizes at higher numbers of bedrooms but the electricity costs for houses plot 
								does not have this problem. We’ve checked all our plots and they look like they all 
								follow an approximately linear relationship.
							</p>
							<p>
								What are the other assumptions for Multiple Linear Regression models? <br>
								1.	Normality - The residuals (AKA the errors) of the model are normally distributed 
								(symmetrically distributed around the mean where data points closer to the mean 
								occur more frequently than data points that are further away from the mean) <br>
								2.	Multicollinearity – The independent variables are not highly correlated with 
								each other. Adding variables that are correlated to the model means that we are being 
								redundant with the information we’re providing to the model. <br>
								3.	Constant Variance – the variance of the residuals should be constant for all values 
								of independent variables. <br>
								4.	Independence – the observations should be independent from each other meaning 
								that the value of one observation doesn’t influence the value of the other observations. <br>
								<br>
								Let’s go through these in more detail.

							</p>
							<subheader>
								<h3><a href="#">Normality</a></h3>
							</subheader>
							<p>
								Let’s look at the normality assumption first by plotting the residuals (errors) against 
								the fitted values. The fitted values are the values of the response variable (electricity) 
								that are predicted by our model based on the data given to the model (the training data). 
								The residuals are just the predicted (fitted) values minus the true electricity cost for 
								each data point (AKA the errors). The red dotted line indicates the zero-error line 
								(where the electricity cost predicted by the model equals the true electricity cost).
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture9.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								There appears to be a violation of the normality assumption since most values are 
								situated above the 0 line, indicating a skew to the right. This violation is not of 
								much concern since the sample size is large, allowing us to apply the Central Limit 
								Theorem. Additionally, it should be noted that the line at the top of the .resid vs 
								.fitted graph, separate from the other points, appears to suggest that our model makes
								 predictions for electricity cost that are much higher than they should be. However, 
								 the sampling method for electricity caused the variable to be "top-coded" meaning that 
								 it is truncated at $999 and, in this case, the model's predictions may actually be more
								  accurate than the recorded data. This is something to consider as a limitation.
							</p>
							<subheader>
								<h3><a href="#">Multicollinearity</a></h3>
							</subheader>
							<p>
								To test for multicollinearity, we can use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) which 
								estimates how much a regression coefficient’s variance is inflated by multicollinearity. 
								The regression coefficient is the independent variable’s corresponding coefficient in 
								the model equation. Here are the VIFs for our regression coefficients:
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture10.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								The general rule is that if the VIFs are below five, then there is no multicollinearity
								 present in the regression coefficients. In our case, it looks like there is no 
								 multicollinearity. If any of your VIFs are above 5 (and definitely if they are above 10),
								  you can consider removing those variables from the model.
							</p>
							<subheader>
								<h3><a href="#">Constant Variance</a></h3>
							</subheader>
							<p>
								To test for constant variance, we can observe the residuals vs. independent variable plots. 
								The variance of the residuals should be constant for all values of independent variables.
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture11.png" alt="" /></a>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture12.png" alt="" /></a>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture13.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								The residuals vs bedrooms (BDSP) plot and the residuals vs household type (HA) plot appear 
								to meet the constant variance assumption. There may be non-constant variance from left to 
								right in the residuals vs. household size (NP) plot, however this may be explained by less 
								observations at high NP values. We will assume constant variance due to the small samples 
								at larger household sizes.
							</p>
							<subheader>
								<h3><a href="#">Independence</a></h3>
							</subheader>
							<p>
								The independence assumption can be assessed by thinking about the sampling techniques used 
								to obtain the data. Randomly sampled data can ensure that any confounding variables are 
								evenly distributed across groups and that the sample is representative of the population
								it came from since each unit is equally likely to be selected. 
							</p>
							<p>
								In our case, the housing units were sampled using systematic sampling where cases are 
								randomly selected at a regular interval. Since each household was sampled randomly, 
								it means that we can extend our inference to all households in Oregon (that have at 
								least one tenant, pay for their electricity, and are not group accommodation) because
								those households are theoretically represented by the sample.
							</p>
							<subheader>
								<h3><a href="#">Model Fitting</a></h3>
							</subheader>
							<p>
								Now that we’ve justified every assumption, we can move on with fitting our multiple 
								linear regression model. <br>
								The following model describes the relationship between monthly electricity cost for a 
								housing unit (ELEPi), the number of occupants within the household (NP), the number of 
								bedrooms in the household (BDSP) and whether the household is a house or an apartment 
								(housei= 1 if house, 0 if apt). The error in the estimate is given by epsiloni. <br>
								<br> 
								ELEPi = beta0 + beta1NP + beta2BDSP + beta3housei + epsiloni
							</p>
							<p>
								Each beta coefficient beta1, beta2, beta3) determines the strength of the effect of 
								its corresponding variable (NP, BDSP, housei). If beta3, the coefficient corresponding 
								to the housing type variable, is equal to 0 then the housing type has no effect on 
								electricity cost, and we can conclude that people living in apartments and those 
								living in houses pay the same in electricity when accounting for the home’s occupancy 
								and number of bedrooms. To test if beta3= 0, we can use a Student's T-test.
							</p>
							<subheader>
								<h3><a href="#">T-Test</a></h3>
							</subheader>
							<p>
								The Student's t-test, first described by William Sealy Gosset in 1908, is used to 
								test a statistical hypothesis when the test-statistic follows a Student's T-distribution 
								(Student, 1908). The t-test has two assumptions:
								<br>
								1. Normality - the sample mean should follow a normal 
								distribution (under the Central Limit Theorem, large samples will 
								approximately follow a normal distribution) <br>
								2. Independence - the observations should be independent from each other.
							</p>
							<p>
							We’ve already justified these assumptions since they’re the same as in the 
							multiple regression model. The next step is to construct null and alternative hypotheses. <br>
							The null hypothesis is always the “uninteresting” claim – the one that predicts no relationship 
							or no effects. In our case, its: <br>
							Null Hypothesis: Houses and apartments have the same electricity costs when controlling 
							for number of bedrooms and occupancy. <br>
							In proper mathematical form, we’d write it as:
							<br>
							H0: beta3 = 0
							<br>
							Where H0 denotes the null hypothesis and beta3 is the coefficient corresponding 
							to the housing type variable.
							<br>
							And the alternative hypothesis is the alternate answer to our question. In this case its:
							<br>
							Alternative Hypothesis: Houses have higher electricity costs than apartments when controlling 
							for number of bedrooms and occupancy.
							<br>
							Or in proper mathematical form,
							<br>
							H0: beta3 > 0
							<br>
							When we run the t-test in r, we get these results:
							</p>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Picture14.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								The resulting estimate is the model’s estimated coefficient for the corresponding 
								independent variable and the standard error gives the standard deviation of the sampling 
								distribution for that coefficient. You can add the standard error or subtract it from
								 the estimate to get the upper and lower confidence intervals, respectively. The confidence 
								 interval gives a range of values that you expect the coefficient to fall between. 
								 To get the 95% confidence interval you need to add or subtract two standard errors from 
								 the estimate because according to the Central Limit Theorem, 95% of values will fall within 
								 2 standard deviations of the mean. In this case, our mean is the coefficient estimate and 
								 the standard deviations are the standard error for that estimate. 	
							</p>
							<p>
								The p-value gives the probability, assuming that the null hypothesis is true, of getting 
								a result as or more extreme than the observed result. For example, say that I predict that 
								50% of my school would choose to eat vanilla ice cream rather than chocolate but my study 
								results showed that only 20% of students at my school would choose vanilla. If I conducted 
								a t-test to test the hypothesis that the proportion of students who prefer vanilla is 50%,
								we could calculate the probability of getting a study result of 20%. If observing a 
								proportion of 20% is very unlikely assuming that the null hypothesis is true, then the 
								null hypothesis is likely untrue. Typically, if the p-value falls below 0.05 (for 95% 
								confidence), we reject the null hypothesis. Other common significance levels (the cut-off
								number used for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis) are 0.01 (99% Confidence), 
								and 0.1 (90% Confidence). The t-value or test statistic pairs well with the p-value because
								it is a value used to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. <br>
								Now that we know what all of the values in the table are, let’s construct our decision. 
							</p>
							<p>
								With a p-value of less than 2.2e-16, we reject the null hypothesis that β3 = 0 (Table 3). 
								In other words, housing type does have an effect on monthly electricity cost. 
								With 95% confidence, people who live in houses pay between $15.96 and $22.99 more in 
								electricity per month, on average, than those living in apartments while controlling 
								for the number of bedrooms and the number of occupants in the household (Table 4). 
							</p>
							<subheader>
								<h3><a href="#">Conclusion</a></h3>
							</subheader>
							<p>
								Statistical hypothesis tests are much more involved than the hypothesis tests we 
								construct in our day-to-day lives. They involve careful data collection strategy, 
								data analysis strategy, estimation of our uncertainty, and efforts to reduce bias.
